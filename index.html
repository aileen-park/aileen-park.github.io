  <h3>My Life</h3>
      <p>I am a 16 year old girl who currently lives in New York.</p>
      <p>I attend a public high school and am planning on majoring in computer science or mechanical engineering when I get to college.</p>
      <p>When I was 7 years old, I was diagnosed with non-Hodkins Lymphoma.</p>
      <p>I was forced to miss most of class during 2nd grade,
        and I made daily visits to the hospital to receive chemotherapy, and I lost all of my hair.</p>
      <p>While at home, I began to write songs to express my emotions, because I believed that it was healthier than bottling all my thoughts. </p>
      <p>So with that, I became a singer song-writer, developing my techniques by focusing on classical singing and piano.</p>
      <p>I hope to find an occupation that will incorporate both my love for music and my creativity in computer science.</p>
